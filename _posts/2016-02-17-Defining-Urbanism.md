The difference between “urban” and “suburban” seems to be taken for granted in American cities.  The distinction is obvious, right?  Urban places have sidewalks, dense buildings, and grid streets.  Suburban areas have self contained neighborhoods of impossible to navigate streets.  Suburban retail is located in big box stores along wide, arterial streets.  The distinctions spill over into social connotations.  Urban areas have “inner city” schools which are viewed as underachieving problems, and suburban areas generally have better funded and more desirable schools.  Flipping the distinctions, suburban areas are lifeless, boring, “cookie cutter” places where people seek to raise families.  Urban areas are centers of culture and business.  They are considered dynamic, unique, and fiercely original.  

Digging a little deeper, the distinctions are less clear.  Where do street car suburbs of the early 20th century fit in?  What about the transitional neighborhoods built in the 1930’s and 40’s?  What about the urban-style developments stuck in the middle of suburban areas?

This [thread] (http://www.city-data.com/forum/urban-planning/942899-urban-vs-suburban-vs-rural-what.html) covers much of the discussion.  There are a few guidelines which might help shape the definition:

1.	Density: 
Urban areas tend to be dense, suburban areas less dense, and rural are generally considered the least dense.  However, density is also tricky to define.  Generally, we think of urban areas having a density of structures rather than people.  Multi-story buildings constructed on zero lot lines creates a sense of density.  Buildings with high floor-area-ratios are found in more urban settings.  Parking garages and on-street are more prevalent than surface parking lots.

2.	Dwelling type:
Dense areas tend to have more multifamily buildings than single family buildings.  Apartments, duplexes, and townhomes tend to be attached and share lot lines.  Architectural style comes into play as well.  Urban areas tend to face the street.  Houses and townhomes have porches and stoops.  Alleys are more common in urban areas.  Apartment building entrances face the street.  In some areas, fire escapes are visible.  This is in contrast to suburban, detached homes which have prominent driveways and garages.

3.	Commercial Spaces:
Urban commercial spaces tend to be located in narrow, ground floor storefront spaces.  They tend to face sidewalks and the outside street.  Suburban commercial spaces generally are set back behind surface parking lots.  

4.	Public Spaces:
Urban public spaces tend to be smaller and more closely integrated with a system of sidewalks and pedestrian infrastructure.  They tend to take the form of plazas, heavily landscaped parks, and memorials.  Suburban public spaces tend to be larger and more open.  Trails are common, as are dedicated sports facilities.  Plazas and square tend to be relatively more rare.

5.	Pedestrian Amenities:
Urban spaces tend to have more pedestrian amenities.  Sidewalks are larger, and there may be street furniture and public waste-baskets.  Intersections may feature special paint or markers for pedestrian crossings.  Street trees and awnings are likely to exist as well.  Suburban areas may have sidewalks, even in neighborhoods, but they tend to lack many of the other amenities present in urban areas.  They also may lack points of interest and any form of shade.

6.	Street Life:
Along the same lines, suburban areas may lack people on the street.  They tend to have fewer sidewalk cafés, retail, and pedestrians.  Urban areas tend to have people on the street throughout the day, from commuters leaving for work in the morning, to buskers and street vendors at night.

Part of the difficulty in coming up with an absolute definition is related to the fact that cities and the places people occupy have are placed on varied geography.  Cities constantly shift and change.  People are the other part of the equation, and it’s something that makes it constantly in flux versus being a simple inventory.  Urban geography is constantly shifting and being remade.  The “rings” of different neighborhoods in a city represent different layers of time with different housing market demands.  All neighborhoods change.

This is meant to be a starting guideline meant to illustrate the challenge in defining areas as absolutely urban and suburban.  In reality, no space is absolutely one or the other, yet we lack standard and vocabulary for filling in the gaps.  New Urbanism proposed the transect system which imagines urban density and intensity along a continuum from rural (T1) to middle-of-Manhattan (T6).  Conceptually, this progressive typology works, especially when proposing a new code.  However, existing areas in cities tend to transition a bit more abruptly or do not neatly fit into the transect system.  Industrial areas, in particular, defy the density scale.  Dense urban neighborhoods with large numbers of vacant lots and surface parking lots, too, are troublesome to fit into a transect scale.  A suburban style neighborhood may sit abruptly next to a central business district.

Urban renewal, interstate construction, and infill redevelopment projects have helped contribute to a sense of fragmentation of urban space.  Spaces and neighborhoods may become cut off from other places over time.  Empty blocks and vacant lots also alter the perception of density in a city.  Large-scale infrastructure, too, can create new and altered networks within existing urban forms.  A suburban drainage system, a railroad, a highway overpass, all of these forms create new possibilities and barriers in the existing urban landscape.  

We lack terms for these varied spaces.  Urban form does not require a single person, yet paradoxically, there is no concept of the city without people.
